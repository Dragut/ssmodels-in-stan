**This is work in progress. It is a template for writing Kalman filters in Stan, but I wouldn't recommend directly using it in your work.** 

Example and code for state-space models in Stan.
This includes an implementation of Kalman filtering, smoothing, and simulation for
dynamic linear models (Gaussian linear state-space models).
