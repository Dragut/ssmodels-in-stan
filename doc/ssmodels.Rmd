# The Linear State Space Model

[@DurbinKoopman2012, Sec 3.1]

The linear Gaussian state space model (SSM)[^dlm] the the $n$-dimensional observation sequence $\vec{y}_1, \dots, \vec{y}_n$,
$$
\begin{aligned}[t]
\vec{y}_t &= \vec{d}_t + \mat{Z}_t \vec{\alpha}_t + \vec{\varepsilon}_t,  &
\vec{\varepsilon}_t & \sim N(0, \mat{H}_t), \\
\vec{\alpha}_{t + 1} &= \vec{c}_t + \mat{T}_t \vec{\alpha}_t + \mat{R}_t \vec{\eta}_t,  &
\vec{\eta}_t & \sim N(0, \mat{Q}_t), \\
&& \vec{\alpha}_1 &\sim N(\vec{a}_1, \mat{P}_1) .
\end{aligned}
$$
for $t = 1, \dots, n$.
The first equation is called the *observation* or *measurement equation*.
The second equation is called the *state*, *transition*, or *system equation*.
The vector $\vec{y}_t$ is a $p \times 1$ vector called the *observation vector*.
The vector $\alpha{\alpha}_t$ is a $m \times 1$ vector called the *state vector*.
The matrices are vectors, $\mat{Z}_t$,$\mat{T}_t$, $\mat{R}_t$, $\mat{H}_t$, $\mat{Q}_t$, $c_t$, and $d_t$ are called the *system matrices*.
The system matrices are considered fixed and known in the filtering and smoothing equations below, but can be parameters themselves.
The $p \times m$ matrix $\mat{Z}_t$ links the observation vector $\vec{y}_t$ with the state vector $\vec{\alpha}_t$.
The $m \times m$ transition matrix $\mat{T}_t$ determines the evolution of the state vector, $\vec{\alpha}_t$.
The $q \times 1$ vector $\vec{\eta}_t$ is called the *state disturbance vector*,
and the $p \times 1$ vector $\vec{\varepsilon}_t$ is called the *observation disturbance vector*.
An assumption is that the state and observation disturbance vectors are uncorrelated, $\Cov(\vec{\varepsilon}_t, \vec{\eta}_t) = 0$.

In a general state space model, the normality assumptions of the densities of $\vec{\varepsilon}$
and $\vec{\eta}$ are dropped.

In many cases $\mat{R}_t$ is the identity matrix.
It is possible to define $\eta^*_t = \mat{R}_t \vec{\eta}_t$, and $\mat{Q}^* = \mat{R}_t \mat{Q}_t' \mat{R}'_t$.
However, if $\mat{R}_t$ is $m \times q$ and $q < m$, and $\mat{Q}_t$ is nonsingular, then it is useful to work with the nonsingular $\vec{\eta}_t$ rather than a singular $\vec{\eta}_t^*$.

The initial state vector $\vec{\alpha}_1$ is assume to be generated as,
$$
\alpha_1 \sim N(\vec{a}_1, \mat{P}_1)
$$
independently of the observation and state disturbances $\vec{\varepsilon}$ and $\vec{\eta}$.
The values of $\vec{a}_1$ and $\mat{P}_1$ can be considered as given and known in most stationary processes.
When the process is nonstationary, the elements of $\vec{a}_1$ need to be treated as unknown and estimated.
This is called *initialization*.

[^dlm]: This is also called a dynamic linear model (DLM).
