The first case consists in the analysis of the well-known (at least to time series analysis experts) Nile data with a local level model. The other case-studies deal with ARIMA and RegARIMA models applied to the (also well-known) Airline time series, structural time series models applied to the Italian industrial production index and stochastic volatility models applied to the FTSE100 index. In all applications inference on the model (hyper-) parameters is carried out by maximum likelihood, but in one case (stochastic volatility) also an MCMC-based approach is illustrated. Cubic splines are covered in a very short example as well.},

SsfPack allows for a full range of different state space forms: from a simple time-invariant model to a complicated time-varying model. Functions can be used which put standard models such as ARMA and cubic spline models in state space form. Basic functions are available for filtering, moment smoothing and simulation smoothing. Ready-to-use functions are provided for standard tasks such as likelihood evaluation, forecasting and signal extraction.

Applications include the comparison of signal extraction weights with those used by nonparametric procedures and the computation of weights assigned to observations in making forecasts. },

This state space approach involves matrices and vectors with dimensions equal to Max (p, q + 1) where p is the order of the autoregression and q is the order of the moving average, rather than matrices with dimensions equal to the number of observations. A key to the calculation of the exact likelihood function is the proper calculation of the initial state covariance matrix. The inclusion of observational error into the model is discussed as is the extension to missing observations. The use of a nonlinear optimization program gives the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters and allows for model identification based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). An example is presented fitting models to western United States drought data.},

The posterior distributions of such underlying cycles can be very informative for policy makers, particularly with regard to the size and direction of the output gap and potential turning points. From the technical point of view a contribution is made in investigating the most appropriate prior distributions for the parameters in the cyclical components and in developing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for both univariate and multivariate models. Applications to \{US\} macroeconomic series are presented. },

In an unobserved-components model, other sets of residuals are available. These auxiliary residuals are estimators of the disturbances associated with the unobserved components. They can often yield information that is less apparent from the innovations, but they suffer from the disadvantage that they are serially correlated even in a correctly specified model with known parameters. This article shows how the properties of the auxiliary residuals may be obtained, how they are related to each other and to the innovations, and how they can be used to construct test statistics. Applications are presented showing how residuals can be used to detect and distinguish between outliers and structural change.},

  Abstract                 = { Time series subject to parameter shifts of random magnitude and timing are commonly modeled with a change-point approach using Chib's algorithm to draw the break dates. We outline some advantages of an alternative approach in which breaks come through mixture distributions in state innovations, and for which the sampler of Gerlach, Carter, and Kohn allows reliable and efficient inference. We show how the same sampler can be used to model shifts in variance that occur independently of shifts in other parameters and how to draw the break dates efficiently when regime durations follow a Poisson process. Finally, we introduce to the time series literature the concept of adaptive Metropolis--Hastings sampling for discrete latent variable models. We develop an easily implemented adaptive algorithm that improves on the work of Gerlach et al. and promises to significantly reduce computing time in a variety of problems including mixture innovation, change-point, regime switching, and outlier detection. The efficiency gains on two models for U.S. inflation and real interest rates are 2.57\% and 3.41\%. },

We present a new technique for this which is both simple and computationally efficient. The treatment includes models with diffuse initial conditions and regression effects. Computational comparisons are made with the previous standard method. Two applications are provided to illustrate the use of the simulation smoother for Gibbs sampling for Bayesian inference and importance sampling for classical inference.},

We first provide some background on the history of state space methods for the analysis of time series. This is followed by a concise overview of linear Gaussian state space analysis including the modelling framework and appropriate estimation methods. We discuss the important class of unobserved component models which incorporate a trend, a seasonal, a cycle, and fixed explanatory and intervention variables for the univariate and multivariate analysis of time series. We continue the discussion by presenting methods for the computation of different estimates for the unobserved state vector: filtering, prediction, and smoothing. Estimation approaches for the other parameters in the model are also considered. Next, we discuss how the estimation procedures can be used for constructing confidence intervals, detecting outlier observations and structural breaks, and testing model assumptions of residual independence, homoscedasticity, and normality. We then show how ARIMA and ARIMA components models fit in the state space framework to time series analysis. We also provide a basic introduction for non-Gaussian state space models. Finally, we present an overview of the software tools currently available for the analysis of time series with state space methods as they are discussed in the other contributions to this special volume.},

Our approach simultaneously generates the whole of the state vector given the mixture and coefficient indicator variables and simultaneously generates all the indicator variables conditional on the state vectors. The states are generated efficiently using the Kalman filter. We illustrate our approach by several examples and empirically compare its performance to another Gibbs sampler where the states are generated one at a time. The empirical results suggest that our approach is both practical to implement and dominates the Gibbs sampler that generates the states one at a time.},

For this data set, Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling algorithms are implemented in the programming language Ox. These Markov chain Monte Carlo methods only provide output conditioned upon the full data set. For filtered output, conditioning only on past observations, the particle filter is introduced. The sampling methods are flexible, and this advantage is used to extend the model to incorporate a stochastic volatility process. The volatility changes both in the Nile data and also in daily S&P 500 return data are investigated. The posterior density of parameters and states is found to provide information on which elements of the model are easily identifiable, and which elements are estimated with less precision.},

  Abstract                 = {This article demonstrates the difficulty that traditional outlier detection methods, such as that of Tsay, have in identifying level shifts in time series. Initializing the outlier/level-shift search with an estimated autoregressive moving average model lowers the power of the level-shift detection statistics. Furthermore, the rule employed by these methods for distinguishing between level shifts and innovation outliers does not work well in the presence of level shifts. A simple modification to Tsay's procedure is proposed that improves the ability to correctly identify level shifts. This modification is relatively easy to implement and appears to be quite effective in practice.},
