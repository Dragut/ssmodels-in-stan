This paper reviews some of the offerings in R to help the prospective user to make an informed choice.},

SsfPack is a suite of C routines for carrying out computations involving the statistical analysis of univariate and multivariate models in state space form. The emphasis is on documenting the link we have made to the Ox computing environment. SsfPack allows for a full range of different state space forms: from a simple time-invariant model to a complicated time-varying model. Functions can be used which put standard models such as ARMA and cubic spline models in state space form. Basic functions are available for filtering, moment smoothing and simulation smoothing. Ready-to-use functions are provided for standard tasks such as likelihood evaluation, forecasting and signal extraction. We show that SsfPack can be easily used for implementing, fitting and analysing Gaussian models relevant to many areas of econometrics and statistics. Some Gaussian illustrations are given.},

This enables prior notions about the duration of cycles to be used, while the generalized class of stochastic cycles employed allows the possibility of relatively smooth cycles being extracted. The posterior distributions of such underlying cycles can be very informative for policy makers, particularly with regard to the size and direction of the output gap and potential turning points. From the technical point of view a contribution is made in investigating the most appropriate prior distributions for the parameters in the cyclical components and in developing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for both univariate and multivariate models. Applications to \{US\} macroeconomic series are presented. },

  Abstract                 = { Time series subject to parameter shifts of random magnitude and timing are commonly modeled with a change-point approach using Chib's algorithm to draw the break dates. We outline some advantages of an alternative approach in which breaks come through mixture distributions in state innovations, and for which the sampler of Gerlach, Carter, and Kohn allows reliable and efficient inference. We show how the same sampler can be used to model shifts in variance that occur independently of shifts in other parameters and how to draw the break dates efficiently when regime durations follow a Poisson process. Finally, we introduce to the time series literature the concept of adaptive Metropolis--Hastings sampling for discrete latent variable models. We develop an easily implemented adaptive algorithm that improves on the work of Gerlach et al. and promises to significantly reduce computing time in a variety of problems including mixture innovation, change-point, regime switching, and outlier detection. The efficiency gains on two models for U.S. inflation and real interest rates are 2.57\% and 3.41\%. },

  Abstract                 = {Numerous anecdotal reports suggest that members of many territorial species use naturally occurring landmarks to define the boundaries of their territories. In the work reported here, we first tested whether artificial landmarks would be adopted as boundaries by territorial male cicada killer wasps, Sphecius speciosus . To perform this test, we set out wooden dowels on a flat, grassy lawn on which male wasps were defending mating territories. The dowels were situated so that they did not coincide with any existing territorial boundary. After we provided the dowels, the wasps established new territorial boundaries coinciding with the dowels. We hypothesized that using visual landmarks as territorial borders might lower defensive costs, and indeed, focal samples on territorial wasps revealed that borders that were defined by dowels cost less to defend than did borders that were not defined by any landmark. This result suggests that the use of natural landmarks as territorial boundaries may have evolved as a result of the reduced defensive costs that accrue to these boundaries. Furthermore, defensive costs may not depend directly on territory size: territory owners may be able to reduce defensive costs by selecting sites with high tactical defensibility.},

We first provide some background on the history of state space methods for the analysis of time series. This is followed by a concise overview of linear Gaussian state space analysis including the modelling framework and appropriate estimation methods. We discuss the important class of unobserved component models which incorporate a trend, a seasonal, a cycle, and fixed explanatory and intervention variables for the univariate and multivariate analysis of time series. We continue the discussion by presenting methods for the computation of different estimates for the unobserved state vector: filtering, prediction, and smoothing. Estimation approaches for the other parameters in the model are also considered. Next, we discuss how the estimation procedures can be used for constructing confidence intervals, detecting outlier observations and structural breaks, and testing model assumptions of residual independence, homoscedasticity, and normality. We then show how ARIMA and ARIMA components models fit in the state space framework to time series analysis. We also provide a basic introduction for non-Gaussian state space models. Finally, we present an overview of the software tools currently available for the analysis of time series with state space methods as they are discussed in the other contributions to this special volume.},

  Abstract                 = {Inference is considered for the point in a sequence of random variables at which the probability distribution changes. An approximation to the conditional distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator of the changepoint given the ancillary values of observations adjacent to the estimated changepoint is derived and shown to be numerically equal to a Bayesian posterior distribution for the changepoint. A hydrological example is given to show that inferences based on the conditional distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator can differ sharply from inferences based on the marginal distribution},

  Abstract                 = {SUMMARY We show how to use the Gibbs sampler to carry out Bayesian inference on a linear state space model with errors that are a mixture of normals and coefficients that can switch over time. Our approach simultaneously generates the whole of the state vector given the mixture and coefficient indicator variables and simultaneously generates all the indicator variables conditional on the state vectors. The states are generated efficiently using the Kalman filter. We illustrate our approach by several examples and empirically compare its performance to another Gibbs sampler where the states are generated one at a time. The empirical results suggest that our approach is both practical to implement and dominates the Gibbs sampler that generates the states one at a time.},

  Abstract                 = {This article demonstrates the difficulty that traditional outlier detection methods, such as that of Tsay, have in identifying level shifts in time series. Initializing the outlier/level-shift search with an estimated autoregressive moving average model lowers the power of the level-shift detection statistics. Furthermore, the rule employed by these methods for distinguishing between level shifts and innovation outliers does not work well in the presence of level shifts. A simple modification to Tsay's procedure is proposed that improves the ability to correctly identify level shifts. This modification is relatively easy to implement and appears to be quite effective in practice.},
