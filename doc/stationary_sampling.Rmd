# Sampling from Autocorrelations

Objective: sample from space in which AR parameters are stationary,
and MA parameters are invertible.
Since these spaces are complicated, it is easiest to transform
the coefficients from an autocorrelation function to a partial autocorrelation function.

See statsmodels.tsa.statespace for multivariate transformation.
