Currently the Kalman filter only handles the special univariate case for ARIMA. The statsmodels module statsmodels.tsa.statespace contains more general state space code. The examples are very good. An example of using statsmodels.tsa.statespace and PyMC to simulate from the posterior of a state space model. See State Space Modeling in Python. Strickland et al. (2014) introduce PySSM to simulate state space models using PyMCMC (not to be confused with the more popular PyMC). "]
